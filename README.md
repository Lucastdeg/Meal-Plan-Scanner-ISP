# Meal-Plan-Scanner-ISP
This repository contains the code and development details for a device that scans ID cards to streamline the lunch process. The system works as follows:

    ID Card Scan – A user scans their ID card using an RFID/NFC scanner (or QR scanning).
    Meal Plan Verification – The system checks if the user has an active meal plan.
    Access Decision – If the meal plan is valid, they are allowed through. Otherwise, access is denied.

This project integrates hardware (RFID/NFC scanner, Raspberry Pi/Arduino, display, etc.) with software (Python, Firebase, real-time verification) to create an efficient and automated lunch access system.
